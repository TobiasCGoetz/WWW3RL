## Tech stack
The page is built with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), a Go based fast and modern static site generator. Currently the [Elate template](https://github.com/saey55/hugo-elate-theme/) is being used to style the aestethics and content of the website. The deployment to S3 is based on the [hugo-s3-action](https://github.com/plopcas/hugo-s3-action).
